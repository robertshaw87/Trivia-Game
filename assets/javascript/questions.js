        {q:"What is the name for the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse?”", a:"Mule", s:["Mare", "Colt", "Stallion", "Jack", "Jenny", "Foal"],
            blurb:"Mule, the hybrid offspring of a male donkey (jackass, or jack) and a female horse (mare). The less-frequent cross between a female ass and a male horse results in a hinny, or hinney, which is smaller than a mule. Mules were beasts of burden in Asia Minor at least 3,000 years ago and are still used today in many parts of the world because of their ability to withstand hardships and perform work under conditions too severe for many other draft and pack animals. Mules are usually sterile."},
        {q:"What is the name for a dog created by crossing a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle?", a:"Labradoodle", s:["Loodle", "Retriedle", "Pootriever", "Looble", "Poobrador"],
            blurb:"Originally developed to be hypoallergenic guide dogs, the first planned crosses of Poodles and Labrador Retrievers were arranged by the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia. The result was a smart and sociable dog who not only possessed a nature appropriate for guide dogs but also had a low-shedding coat. While the hybrid is not yet achieving consistent results in coat or temperament, she is a wildly popular and affectionate dog."},
        {q:"What is the only bird known to fly backwards?", a:"Hummingbird", s:["Canary", "Blue Jay", "Raven", "Dove", "Sparrow","Woodpecker"],
            blurb:"Hummingbirds are small, colorful birds with iridescent feathers. Their name comes from the fact that they flap their wings so fast (about 80 times per second) that they make a humming noise. Hummingbirds can fly right, left, up, down, backwards, and even upside down. They are also able to hover by flapping their wings in a figure-8 pattern. They have a specialized long and tapered bill that is used to obtain nectar from the center of long, tubular flowers. The hummingbird’s feet are used for perching only, and are not used for hopping or walking."},
        {q:"A panda’s daily diet consists almost entirely of what plant?", a:"Bamboo", s:["Eucalyptus", "Acacia Trees", "Algae", "Ficus Trees"],
            blurb:"This peaceful creature with a distinctive black and white coat is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. Pandas live mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat from 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, a formidable task for which they use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs."},
        {q:"What is the name for a male bee that comes from an unfertilized egg?", a:"Drone", s:["Worker", "Bachelor", "Soldier", "King"],
            blurb:"The drones' main function is to be ready to fertilize a receptive queen. Drones in a hive do not usually mate with a virgin queen of the same hive because they drift from hive to hive. Mating generally takes place in or near drone congregation areas. How these areas are selected is poorly understood, but they do exist. Although the drone is highly specialized to perform one function, mating and continuing the propagation of the hive, it is not completely without side benefit to it. All bees, when they sense the hive's temperature deviating from proper limits, either generate heat by shivering, or exhaust heat by moving air with their wings—behaviours which drones share with worker bees."},
        {q:"What is the most popular breed of dog in the United States?", a:"Labrador Retriever", s:["Golden Retriever", "German Shepherd", "Poodles", "Bulldogs", "Siberian Huskies", "Great Danes", "Welsh Corgis", "Shih Tzu", "Pomeranians"],
            blurb:"Labrador Retrievers are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don’t mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit."},
        {q:"The Alaskan Malamute is a type of what?", a:"Dog", s:["Bear", "Elk", "Deer", "Hare", "Fish"],
            blurb:"Everything about Malamutes suggests their origin as an arctic sledge dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, “I work hard for a living!” But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family “pack,” the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn’t respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with—playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids."},
        {q:"On what continent would you not find bees?", a:"Antarctica", s:["Australia", "North America", "South America", "Africa", "Europe", "Asia"],
            blurb:"They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. Some species including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees."}]

        {q:"What dog breed native to Japan has a name that translates to “little brushwood dog”?", a:"Shiba Inu", s:["Shikoku", "Akita", "Kishu", "Tosa", "Kai-Ken"],
            blurb: "It is believed this breed, whose name in Japanese means brushwood, originated over 3,000 years ago. Bred to hunt primarily birds and small game animals, the dog would occasionally hunt for deer, boar, and bear with his owner. A smaller member of the American Kennel Club’s non-sporting group, this self-assured pooch is known for his “Shiba scream” when he gets excited."},
        {q:"What spiny venous fish, common in home aquariums, has become an invasive species in the Caribbean Sea and U.S. Atlantic coastal waters?", a:"Lionfish", s:["Stonefish", "Scorpionfish", "Stargazer Fish", "Toadfish", "Cherry Barb", "Fire Mouth Cichilid", "Tiger Pleco", "Betta"],
            blurb: "The lionfish, a longstanding showstopper in home aquariums, is a flourishing invasive species in U.S. Southeast and Caribbean coastal waters. This invasive species has the potential to harm reef ecosystems because it is a top predator that competes for food and space with overfished native stocks such as snapper and grouper. Scientists fear that lionfish will also kill off helpful species such as algae-eating parrotfish, allowing seaweed to overtake the reefs. In the U.S., the lionfish population is continuing to grow and increase its range. This is largely because lionfish have no known predators and reproduce all year long; a mature female releases roughly two million eggs a year."},
        {q:"Which snake, who’s untreated bite is almost 100 percent fatal, is the world’s fastest snake on land?", a:"Black Mamba", s:["Rattlesnake", "Indian Cobra", "Coastal Taipan", "Common Krait", "Saw-scaled Viper", "King Cobra", "Common Death Adder", "Tiger Snake"],
            blurb: "The African Black Mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) is a large and highly venomous snake species native to much of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is the second longest venomous snake species in the world and is the fastest moving land snake, capable of moving at 4.32 to 5.4 metres per second (16–20 km/h, 10–12 mph). It is the most feared and most dangerous snake species in Africa and it has a reputation as a fierce and territorial snake. When warding off a threat, the black mamba delivers multiple strikes, injecting large amounts of virulently toxic venom with each strike, often landing bites on the body or head."},
        {q:"What is the sleepiest animal in the world, sleeping around 20 hours each day?", a:"Koala", s:["Sloth", "Lion", "Panda", "Garter Snake", "Possum"],
            blurb:"Because they get so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 hours a day; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement. They are predominantly active at night and spend most of their waking hours feeding. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as long as a day. On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree and hugs it to lose heat without panting. During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy."},
        {q:"What is the proper term for a group of parrots?", a:"Pandemonium", s:["Fleet", "Flamboyance", "Crew", "Flight", "Flock", "Parliament", "Chattering", "Ostentation"],
            blurb:"Parrots may not make good pets for most people because of their natural wild instincts such as screaming and chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, they often become aggressive when mature (partly due to mishandling and poor training) and may bite, causing serious injury. For this reason, parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed through at least five homes before reaching their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. The parrots' ability to mimic human words and their bright colours and beauty prompt impulse buying from unsuspecting consumers."},
        {q:"Which mammal has the longest gestation period?", a:"Elephant", s:["Human", "Blue Whale", "Western Gorilla", "Rhinoceros", "Brown Bear"],
            blurb:"Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, while male elephants tend to live in isolation. A single calf is born to a female once every 4-5 years and after a gestation period of 22 months—the longest of any mammal. These calves stay with their mothers for years and are also cared for by other females in the group."},
        {q:"Which animal has the longest tongue relative to its total size?", a:"Chameleon", s:["Frog", "Anteater", "Hummingbird", "Pangolin", "Sun Bear"],
            blurb:"Chameleons don’t move around very fast, so they use their incredibly long tongue to catch the insects they eat. They are able to stick the tongue out of their mouth very quickly. The end of the tongue is a ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey, it rapidly forms a small suction cup to pull insects back into the mouth to be crushed by its powerful jaws. In some species, the tongue is longer than the body!"},
        {q:"Lemurs, a type of primate, are native to what island nation?", a:"Madagascar", s:["Australia", "New Zealand", "The Phillipines", "Japan", "The United Kingdom"],
            blurb:"Lemurs belong to a group called prosimian primates, defined as all primates that are neither monkeys nor apes. Though there are many species of lemur, there are very few individuals. Lemurs are considered the most endangered group of animals on the planet. These primates are only found in Madagascar. Many species have small and decreasing numbers."},
        {q:"Chilean sea bass originally went by what less appetizing name?", a:"Patagonian Toothfish", s:["Seragogien Lungfish", "Lieran Spikefish", "Ciaran Spinefish", "Arithius Tunnelfish", "Linathian Firefish"],
            blurb:'The name "Chilean Seabass" was invented by a fish wholesaler named Lee Lantz in 1977. He was looking for a name that would make it attractive to the American market. He considered "Pacific sea bass" and "South American sea bass" before settling on "Chilean sea bass". In 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted "Chilean Seabass" as an "alternative market name" for Patagonian toothfish, and in 2013 for Antarctic toothfish.'}]
